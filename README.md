Basic Requirements:
We have remixed the Guts man stage from Mega Man 1. We specifically focused on the part where the platforms drop while gliding along the line. We also replicated the part of every Mega Man stage where you incorporate 2 different challenges throughout the level then combine them towards the end. Then for the second level we remixed the Cut Man boss fight to follow basic Mega Man structure. We also added appropriate music throughout the game. We found sound effects to match the feel of the game accurately. We also made sure that the level would fit in the given playtime.

Art Requirements:
All art assets were made by our team specifically our artist and up to a satisfactory standard. We also made enough to meet the quantity specified. The menu art was created to match the feel of the original game.

Code Requirements:
All code was implemented by our team specifically our coder. We made sure that the code was operational and that the game wouldn't crash. The mechanics we chose to replicate were the Shooting mechanic, the charging mechanic, and the jump mechanic. All of which can be combined of course just like the original.

Tech Requirements:
Both levels were designed by the team specifically our tech. The game contains menu screens with the specified requirements. There aren't any dead ends or other such level design errors at any point in the level.

Other Requirements:
Each item specified in the list were all designed by the tech, coded by the coder, and created by the artist. There was of course sharing in these roles in order to keep down on confusion and up on production to match our vision for the game.
